# My New Blog


This project is the new wheel that I maked. And after learning Angularjs, I want to write some useful code by the knownology, so as I have done before, I also write a new blog this time.

Deployment steps:

	git clone https://github.com/MrHuxu/ng_blog.git
	cd ng_blog
	npm install
	
This step clone all the code and install the packages used in backend code.

	npm install bower -g
	cd public
	bower install
	
This step will install all the packages used in frontend.

In a word, coding with Angular is a fanty experience, and I fell in love with operating the data in frontend instead of the doms, that makes everything magical!

Todo:

1. Make the page more beautiful
2. Optimize the animation
3. Use drop-and-refresh instead of pagination
