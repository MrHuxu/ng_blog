# My New Blog

[TOC]

## Introduction
This project is the new wheel that I maked. And after learning Angularjs, I want to write some useful code by the knownology, so as I have done before, I write a new blog this time.

## Deployment

1. Get the source code from GitHub.

        git clone https://github.com/MrHuxu/ng_blog.git
      
2. Install necesarry packages.

        cd ng_blog
        npm install
  
    This step will install both npm and bower packages.
    
3. Running this app by using ```gulp```.

        npm install gulp -g
        gulp develop  # visit this app at http://localhost:8080


## Summary
In a word, coding with Angular is a fanty experience, and I fell in love with operating the data in frontend instead of the doms, that makes everything magical!

## Todo

1. Make the page more beautiful
2. Optimize the animation
3. Use drop-and-refresh instead of pagination
